OVERVIEW:

Pictures are memories. And everyone of us loves to stitch up many memories together to make the perfect collages. I know there are lot of apps out there that can help to build the best of the collages, but I made a small attempt to build a small image stitching script that allows to accomplish the same.

WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM DO:

As mentioned above, this is a simple program that will allow you to stitch the images selected and make a collage. It uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to help resizing and combining the images.
